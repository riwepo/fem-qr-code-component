## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used Sass for the first time - just some simple class nesting.
I defined my colors by color as CSS variables, and then by use, as I had seen on the internet.
I used a root font size of 62.5% in order to get 10px/rem.
I learned about the dvh property, which solves a problem on mobile.
I learned how to import fonts into the CSS, previously I have linked to the HTML.
